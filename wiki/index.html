                 <span class="letter">T</span><b>he Hundred Years' War</b> was a series of conflicts in Western Europe from 1337 to 1453, waged between the House of Plantagenet 
                 and its cadet House of Lancaster, rulers of the Kingdom of England, and the House of Valois over the right to rule the Kingdom of France. 
                 It was one of the most notable conflicts of the Middle Ages, in which five generations of kings from two rival dynasties fought 
                 for the throne of the largest kingdom in Western Europe. The war marked both the height of chivalry and its subsequent decline, 
                 and the development of stronger national identities in both countries. Later historians adopted the term "Hundred Years' War" 
                 as a historiographical periodisation to encompass these conflicts, constructing the longest military conflict in European history. 
                 It is common to divide the war into three phases, separated by truces: the Edwardian War (1337–1360), the Caroline War (1369–1389), and the Lancastrian War (1415–1453). 
                 Although each side drew many allies into the war, in the end, the House of Valois retained the French throne and the English and French monarchies remained separate.

                         The root causes of the conflict can be traced to the crises of 14th-century Europe. The outbreak of war 
                         was motivated by a gradual rise in tension between the kings of France and England involving Gascony, 
                         Flanders and Scotland. The question that arose was the official pretext due to an interruption of the direct 
                         male line of the Capetian dynasty..

                     Tensions between the French and English crowns had gone back centuries to the origins of the English royal family, 
                     which was French (Norman, and later, Angevin) in origin. English monarchs had therefore historically held titles and 
                     lands within France, which made them vassals to the kings of France. The status of the English king's French fiefs 
                     was a major source of conflict between the two monarchies throughout the Middle Ages. French monarchs systematically 
                     sought to check the growth of English power, stripping away lands as the opportunity arose, particularly whenever England 
                     was at war with Scotland, an ally of France. English holdings in France had varied in size, at some points dwarfing even 
                     the French royal domain; by 1337, however, only Gascony was English. In 1328, Charles IV of France died without sons or 
                     brothers and a new principle disallowed female succession. Charles's closest male relative was his nephew Edward III of England, 
                     whose mother, Isabella of France, was Charles's sister. Isabella claimed the throne of France for her son, but the French 
                     nobility rejected it, maintaining that Isabella could not transmit a right she did not possess. An assembly of French barons 
                     decided that a native Frenchman should receive the crown, rather than Edward. So the throne passed instead, to Charles's patrilineal 
                     cousin, Philip, Count of Valois. Edward protested but ultimately submitted and did homage for Gascony. Further French disagreements 
                     with Edward induced Philip, during May 1337, to meet with his Great Council in Paris. It was agreed that Gascony should be taken back 
                     into Philip's hands, which prompted Edward to renew his claim for the French throne, this time by force of arms.

                             The question of female succession to the French throne was raised after the death of Louis X in 1316. 
                             Louis X left only one daughter, and John I of France, who only lived for five days. Furthermore, the paternity of his daughter 
                             was in question, as her mother, Margaret of Burgundy, had been exposed as an adulterer in the Tour de Nesle affair. 
                             Philip, Count of Poitiers, brother of Louis X, positioned himself to take the crown, advancing the stance that women 
                             should be ineligible to succeed to the French throne. Through his political sagacity he won over his adversaries and succeeded 
                             to the French throne as Philip V. By the same law that he procured, his daughters were denied the succession, which passed 
                             to his younger brother, Charles IV, in 1322.

                             Tensions between the French and English monarchies can be traced back to the 1066 Norman conquest of England, in which the English 
                             throne was seized by the Duke of Normandy, a vassal of the King of France. As a result, the crown of England was held by a succession 
                             of nobles who already owned lands in France, which put them among the most powerful subjects of the French King, as they could now 
                             draw upon the economic power of England to enforce their interests in the mainland. To the kings of France, this dangerously threatened 
                             their royal authority, and so they would constantly try to undermine English rule in France, while the English monarchs would struggle 
                             to protect and expand their lands. This clash of interests was the root cause of much of the conflict between the French and English monarchies 
                             throughout the medieval era.

                             The Anglo-Norman dynasty that had ruled England since the Norman conquest of 1066 was brought to an end when Henry, the son of Geoffrey 
                             of Anjou and Empress Matilda, and great-grandson of William the Conqueror, became the first of the Angevin kings of England in 1154 as Henry II.
                             The Angevin kings ruled over what was later known as the Angevin Empire, which included more French territory than that under the kings of France. 
                             The Angevins still owed homage for these territories to the French king. From the 11th century, the Angevins had autonomy within their French domains, 
                             neutralising the issue.

                             The dispute over Guyenne is even more important than the dynastic question in explaining the outbreak of the war. Guyenne posed a significant 
                             problem to the kings of France and England: Edward III was a vassal of Philip VI of France because of his French possessions and was required 
                             to recognise the suzerainty of the King of France over them. In practical terms, a judgment in Guyenne might be subject to an appeal to the French 
                             royal court. The King of France had the power to revoke all legal decisions made by the King of England in Aquitaine, which was unacceptable 
                             to the English. Therefore, sovereignty over Guyenne was a latent conflict between the two monarchies for several generations. 
                             The King of France agreed to restore Guyenne, minus Agen. But the French delayed the return of the lands, which helped Philip VI. On 6 June 1329, Edward III 
                             finally paid homage to the King of France. However, at the ceremony, Philip VI had it recorded that the homage was not due to the fiefs detached from the 
                             duchy of Guyenne by Charles IV (especially Agen). For Edward, the homage did not imply the renunciation of his claim to the extorted lands.

                             During the War of Saint-Sardos, Charles of Valois, father of Philip VI, invaded Aquitaine on behalf of Charles IV and conquered the duchy 
                             after a local insurrection, which the French believed had been incited by Edward II of England. Charles IV grudgingly agreed to return 
                             this territory in 1325. To recover his duchy, Edward II had to compromise: he sent his son, the future Edward III, to pay homage.

                             At the end of April 1337, Philip of France was invited to meet the delegation from England but refused. The arrière-ban, literally a call to arms, was proclaimed throughout 
                             France starting on 30 April 1337. Then, in May 1337, Philip met with his Great Council in Paris. It was agreed that the Duchy of Aquitaine, effectively Gascony, should be taken back 
                             into the king's hands on the grounds that Edward III was in breach of his obligations as vassal and had sheltered the king's 'mortal enemy' Robert d'Artois. 
                             Edward responded to the confiscation of Aquitaine by challenging Philip's right to the French throne.

                             When Charles IV died, Edward had made a claim for the succession of the French throne, through the right of his mother Isabella (Charles IV's sister), daughter of Philip IV. 
                             Any claim was considered invalidated by Edward's homage to Philip VI in 1329. Edward revived his claim and in 1340 formally assumed the title 'King of France and the French Royal Arms'.

                             Relations with Flanders were also tied to the English wool trade, since Flanders' principal cities relied heavily on textile production and England supplied much of the raw material they needed. 
                             Edward III had commanded that his chancellor sit on the woolsack in council as a symbol of the pre-eminence of the wool trade. At the time there were about 110,000 sheep in Sussex alone. 
                             The great medieval English monasteries produced large surpluses of wool that were sold to mainland Europe. Successive governments were able to make large amounts of money by taxing it. 
                             France's sea power led to economic disruptions for England, shrinking the wool trade to Flanders and the wine trade from Gascony.

                             Edward invaded France, for the third and last time, hoping to capitalise on the discontent and seize the throne. The Dauphin's strategy was that of non-engagement with the English army in the field. 
                             However, Edward wanted the crown and chose the cathedral city of Reims for his coronation (Reims was the traditional coronation city). However, the citizens of Reims built and reinforced the city's 
                             defences before Edward and his army arrived.Edward besieged the city for five weeks, but the defences held and there was no coronation. Edward moved on to Paris, but retreated after a few skirmishes 
                             in the suburbs. Next was the town of Chartres.

                             Disaster struck in a freak hailstorm on the encamped army, causing over 1,000 English deaths – the so-called Black Monday on Easter 1360. This devastated Edward's army and forced him to negotiate 
                             when approached by the French. A conference was held at Brétigny that resulted in the Treaty of Brétigny (8 May 1360). The treaty was ratified at Calais in October. In return for increased lands in Aquitaine, 
                             Edward renounced Normandy, Touraine, Anjou and Maine and consented to reduce King John's ransom by a million crowns. Edward also abandoned his claim to the crown of France.

                             In 1366 there was a civil war of succession in Castile (part of modern Spain). The forces of the ruler Peter of Castile were pitched against those of his half-brother Henry of Trastámara. 
                             The English crown supported Peter; the French supported Henry. French forces were led by Bertrand du Guesclin, a Breton, who rose from relatively humble beginnings to prominence as one of France's war leaders. 
                             Charles V provided a force of 12,000, with du Guesclin at their head, to support Trastámara in his invasion of Castile.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                             Peter appealed to England and Aquitaine's Black Prince for help, but none was forthcoming, forcing Peter into exile in Aquitaine. The Black Prince had previously agreed to support Peter's claims but concerns 
                             over the terms of the treaty of Brétigny led him to assist Peter as a representative of Aquitaine, rather than England. He then led an Anglo-Gascon army into Castile. Peter was restored to power after 
                             Trastámara's army was defeated at the Battle of Nájera.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                             Although the Castilians had agreed to fund the Black Prince, they failed to do so. The Prince was suffering from ill health and returned with his army to Aquitaine. To pay off debts incurred during the Castile 
                             campaign, the prince instituted a hearth tax. Arnaud-Amanieu VIII, Lord of Albret had fought on the Black Prince's side during the war. Albret, who already had become discontented by the influx of English 
                             administrators into the enlarged Aquitaine, refused to allow the tax to be collected in his fief. He then joined a group of Gascon lords who appealed to Charles V for support in their refusal to pay the tax. 
                             Charles V summoned one Gascon lord and the Black Prince to hear the case in his High Court in Paris. The Black Prince answered that he would go to Paris with sixty thousand men behind him. War broke out again and Edward III 
                             resumed the title of King of France. Charles V declared that all the English possessions in France were forfeited, and before the end of 1369 all of Aquitaine was in full revolt.

                             The French victory marked the end of a long period of instability that had started with the Norman Conquest (1066), when William the Conqueror added "King of England" to his titles, becoming both the vassal to (as Duke of Normandy) 
                             and the equal of (as king of England) the king of France. When the war ended, England was bereft of its Continental possessions, leaving it with only Calais on the continent. The war destroyed the English dream of a joint monarchy 
                             and led to the rejection in England of all things French, but the French language in England, which had served as the language of the ruling classes and commerce there from the time of the Norman conquest, left many vestiges in English vocabulary. 
                             English became the official language in 1362 and French was no longer used for teaching from 1385.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                             National feeling that emerged from the war unified both France and England further. Despite the devastation on its soil, the Hundred Years' War accelerated the process of transforming France from a feudal monarchy to a centralised state. 
                             In England the political and financial troubles which emerged from the defeat were a major cause of the War of the Roses (1455–1487).
                         </p>
                         <p>
                             Lowe (1997) argued that opposition to the war helped to shape England's early modern political culture. Although anti-war and pro-peace spokesmen generally failed to influence outcomes at the time, they had a long-term impact. 
                             England showed decreasing enthusiasm for conflict deemed not in the national interest, yielding only losses in return for high economic burdens. In comparing this English cost-benefit analysis with French attitudes, 
                             given that both countries suffered from weak leaders and undisciplined soldiers, Lowe noted that the French understood that warfare was necessary to expel the foreigners occupying their homeland. Furthermore, 
                             French kings found alternative ways to finance the war – sales taxes, debasing the coinage – and were less dependent than the English on tax levies passed by national legislatures. 
                             English anti-war critics thus had more to work with than the French.

                             Bubonic plague and warfare reduced population numbers throughout Europe during this period. France lost half its population during the Hundred Years' War. Normandy lost three-quarters of its population, and Paris two-thirds.
                             The population of England was reduced by 20 to 33 percent due to plague in the same period.

                             In 1445 the first regular standing army in Western Europe since Roman times was organised in France partly as a solution to marauding free companies. The mercenary companies were given a choice of either joining the Royal 
                             army as compagnies d'ordonnance on a permanent basis, or being hunted down and destroyed if they refused. France gained a total standing army of around 6,000 men, which was sent out to gradually eliminate the remaining 
                             mercenaries who insisted on operating on their own. The new standing army had a more disciplined and professional approach to warfare than its predecessors.

                         <p>
                             The Hundred Years' War was a time of rapid military evolution. Weapons, tactics, army structure and the social meaning of war all changed, partly in response to the war's costs, partly through advancement in technology 
                             and partly through lessons that warfare taught. The feudal system was slowly disintegrating throughout the hundred years war.

                         <p>
                             By the war's end, although the heavy cavalry was still considered the most powerful unit in an army, the heavily armoured horse had to deal with several tactics developed to deny or mitigate its effective use on a battlefield. 
                             The English began using lightly armoured mounted troops, known as hobelars. Hobelars' tactics had been developed against the Scots, in the Anglo-Scottish wars of the 14th century. Hobelars rode smaller unarmoured horses, 
                             enabling them to move through difficult or boggy terrain where heavier cavalry would struggle. Rather than fight while seated on the horse, they would dismount to engage the enemy.
